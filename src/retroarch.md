# Retroarch Guide

RetroArch on Android requires manual post-install steps to work. Here are some suggestions on our end.

Note: Only use cores labeled "Lower End" if you are experiencing poor emulation speed from the other options suggested.

## Arcade:
- FinalBurn Neo 
- MAME 

Both play different games, I suggest having both.

**Lower End:**
- MAME 2003-Plus

## Game Boy / Color: 
- SameBoy

**Lower End**
- Gambatte
- Gearboy

## Game Boy Advance:
- mGBA

If mGBA does not work, VBA-M can be used.

## MS DOS:
- DOSBox-Pure

## MSX:
- blueMSX

## NEC PC Engine:
- Beetle PCE Fast

Accurate can be used for higher end devices if desired.

## Nintendo DS: 
- melonDS DS (Note the extra "DS")

If melonDS DS does not work, DesMuMe can be used.

## Nintendo Entertainment System: 
- Mesen 
- Nestopia UE

**Lower End**
- FCEUmm

- Mupen64Plus-Next GLES3 (Use GLES2 if this does not work)

Note that this is not a comprehensive list and is subject to the power of your Android device. For systems not listed, try one of the cores suggested. I simply do not own every single system RetroArch supports.

It is **NOT** suggested to use the RetroArch cores for PPSSPP, PCSX2, Citra, or Dolphin as they are notably out of date.
