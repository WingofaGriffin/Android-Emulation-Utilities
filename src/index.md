Welcome to the Android Emulation Utilities Wiki.

Android Emulation Utilities is a tool used to easily install Android Emulation apps and tools to your device from your PC.

You can see the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/WingofaGriffin/Android-Emulation-Utilities/) for more information, or download the [latest release](https://github.com/WingofaGriffin/Android-Emulation-Utilities/releases/latest).

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! While this script is fully open source and is easily reviewable, there is always a risk of your device not behaving as expected, especially with the large number of Android devices that are all configured slightly differently. I cannot guarantee your specific device is compatible. Take this statement as a disclaimer.
