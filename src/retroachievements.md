Follow the following guides to set up RetroAchievements for supported emulators. If the emulator you are using is not on this list, it likely does not support RetroAchievements.

- [RetroArch](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/)
- [DuckStation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c75mWkd-eI)
- NetherSX2 - Basically the same as DuckStation
- [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/docs/reference/retro-achievements/)
