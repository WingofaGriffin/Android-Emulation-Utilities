# Custom Drivers

You may have better performance using custom drivers for some emulators.

Emulators with Custom Video Drivers:
- sudachi
- Citra
- Vita3k

You can find where to upload them in the settings profile.

Typically I suggest using the "Turnip" drivers. You can find them [here](https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases).
